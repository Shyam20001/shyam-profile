## 📝 Introduction

This starter pack is designed for developers who want to build scalable, efficient, and high-performance web applications using a blend of Node.js, Rust, and cutting-edge JavaScript technologies. By leveraging **cluster management**, **service workers**, **web workers**, and **Hono-SSR**, this setup ensures your application can handle high traffic with ease.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Service Workers**: Enhance performance by managing caching and background tasks.
- **Web Workers**: Run scripts in background threads for better performance.
- **Cluster**: Utilize multiple CPU cores to handle concurrent requests.
- **Hono-SSR**: A lightweight framework for server-side rendering with Hono.
- **React Client**: Build interactive user interfaces with React.
- **N-API (napi-rs)**: Integrate Rust with Node.js for performance-critical tasks.
- **Vitest**: A blazing-fast unit test framework.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (v10 or higher)
- **Rust** (for native addons)

### Installation

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Features

- **Integrate Additional Rust Modules**: Extend the `@bunvader/rustacean` package with new Rust functionalities and expose them to Node.js via N-API.
- **Enhance the React Client**: Use Vite to add new React components and libraries as needed.
- **Optimize Performance**: Utilize Node.js cluster and worker threads to handle more concurrent users.

### Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is used for styling. Customize your styles by editing the `src/styles/styles.css` file and adjusting the `tailwind.config.js` as needed.
